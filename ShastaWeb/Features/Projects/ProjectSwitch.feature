Feature: ProjectSwitch
	
	As a Project Manager User, I would like to switch Projects
	Without leaving the Project Management Module

@Projects
@Functional

Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
	And I have entered 70 into the calculator
	When I press add
	Then the result should be 120 on the screen
